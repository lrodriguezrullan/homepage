					<h3>Experience</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
			I got my first software development job during my sophomore year in college. I worked part time at <a href="http://www.spectron-msim.com">Spectron</a>, an oil analysis laboratory, maintaining their Mechanical Systems Integrity Management (MSIM) software using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_BASIC">Rocky Mountain BASIC</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
			When I graduated college I began working full-time at Spectron. I worked on migrating the MSIM software to Windows using C/C++, Delphi, Watcom SQL, and MS SQL Server. They gave me the opportunity to travel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tembagapura">Tembagapura</a>, Indonesia, to install the MSIM system on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasberg_mine">a remote mine</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
			After six years at Spectron, I went to work with the <a href="http://ogp.pr.gov">Office of Management and Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico (OMB)</a>. I started as a Programming and Communication Systems Consultant, working with the agency's Lotus Notes mail servers, Web site, and firewall. After about a year, I was promoted to Information Systems Operations Manager and put in charge of the operation of the IT infrastructure of the agency, including the government WAN.
				</p>
				<p>
			After three and a half years at OMB, I partnered with a few friends to start T-30, an IT consulting firm. I worked at T-30 for about a year before to going to work with <a href="http://www.softekpr.com/en">Softek</a> as a contract Senior Systems Analyst for several clients, including Puerto Rico Telephone and the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund Corporation. Most of my work at Softek was developing and maintaining intranet applications using Lotus Domino, Java, JDBC, and Oracle PL/SQL.
				</p>
				<p>
			After almost 5 years at Softek, I decided to take a year off work to complete my last year of Law School. Shortly after (successfully!) taking the bar exam, I returned to Puerto Rico Telephone (now Claro), first as an Independent Contractor and later as an employee of Line-of-Sight, Inc. I continued to work with Lotus Domino, Java, JDBC, and Oracle PL/SQL, but also developed and maintained several applications using Spring Framework, Hibernate, and jQuery.
				</p>
				<p>
			After five years at Line-of-Sight, I received an offer from Tempus Nova that I could not refuse. We packed up our bags and moved 3,000 miles west to the Rocky Mountains!
